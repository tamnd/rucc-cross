//! Properties every description has to have, and the demonstration that a sixth one is data.
//!
//! Design: `spec/06-abis.md` section 6.7.
//!
//! A description language buys nothing if a wrong description is as easy to write as a right one.
//! The classifier cannot tell the difference between a rule list that ends in a catch-all and one
//! that does not, so these are the invariants the classifier assumes and does not check, checked
//! here once for every description rather than argued about once per review.
//!
//! `a_sixth_abi_is_a_description_and_no_code` is the one that decides whether section 6.7's
//! proposal was worth making. It adds the s390x ELF ABI in this file, as data, and classifies
//! against it. If that test ever needs a change under `src/` to keep passing, the claim that
//! bringing up an ABI is a data change has stopped being true and the crate needs rethinking
//! rather than extending.
