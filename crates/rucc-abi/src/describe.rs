//! The language an ABI is described in.
//!
//! Design: `spec/06-abis.md` section 6.7.
//!
//! # The argument, restated
//!
//! `spec/06-abis.md` section 6.1 lists fifteen psABIs and the compiler has four of them today,
//! hand written, at about a thousand lines. Fifteen at that rate is six to ten thousand lines of
//! the most bug prone code in a compiler, and `spec/02-the-goal.md` claim 3 says the per target
//! line count outside the target crate and the rule set has to be zero.
//!
//! # Where the line is drawn, and why here
//!
//! The tempting version of this idea is to make everything data, and it does not work. The SysV
//! eightbyte merge is a real algorithm with a real fixed point, the homogeneous aggregate scan
//! walks a list and compares members, and writing either as a table produces an interpreter that
//! is longer than the four functions it replaced and slower than all of them.
//!
//! So the split is between mechanism and policy. The mechanisms are code, in [`crate::classify`],
//! and there are four of them across the five ABIs described here: cut into eightbytes and merge,
//! look for a homogeneous run of floating point members, look for a one or two member aggregate
//! with a floating point member in it, and check the size against a list. The policies are data,
//! and a policy is which mechanisms an ABI applies, in what order, with what limits, and what
//! happens when the registers a mechanism wanted are not there.
//!
//! That split is what makes the count work. The fifth ABI reuses a mechanism and costs a
//! description. The eleventh probably does too. A new mechanism is a real cost and it is paid
//! once per idea rather than once per target, and there are far fewer ideas than targets.
//!
//! # The performance objection
//!
//! Section 6.7 raises it against itself: a compile time decision becoming a run time table walk,
//! on the hot path. Two answers. The classifier runs once per call site and once per function
//! signature rather than once per instruction, so the exposure is bounded, and the descriptions
//! are `const` data reached through a `&'static`, so the branch predictor sees the same rule list
//! for every call in a translation unit.
//!
//! Bounded is a prediction rather than a measurement, and the measurement is `spec/02-the-goal.md`
//! claim 2's benchmark at the migration point. The fallback if it fails is written down in
//! section 6.7: the descriptions stay as the source of truth for the tests and the documentation
//! and the classifiers go back to being hand written, which loses claim 3 and keeps claim 2.
//! Claim 2 outranks claim 3.
