//! Type sizes, alignments and signedness, which is the half of a psABI that decides whether a
//! header is read correctly.
//!
//! Design: `spec/06-abis.md` section 6.2 items 1 to 3.
//!
//! Section 6.2 splits a psABI into twelve independent decisions and then splits those into two
//! groups. Items 4 to 9 decide whether a call works, and the differential harness of
//! `spec/14-testing.md` is what tests them. Items 1 to 3 plus item 11 decide whether a *header*
//! is interpreted correctly, and those are this file.
//!
//! The second group is cheaper to test and catches more, which is why `spec/06-abis.md` section
//! 6.8 puts the `_Static_assert` corpus first for every new ABI: it costs nothing to run, needs
//! no target machine and no execution, and it catches every layout disagreement there is. The
//! corpus is generated from this description, which is why the description comes first.
//!
//! # The two traps
//!
//! A `long double`'s width and its format are separate facts. Sixteen bytes on x86-64 Linux of
//! which eighty bits are the value, eight bytes and a plain `double` on Darwin and Windows,
//! IEEE binary128 on AArch64 Linux and s390x and RISC-V, and IBM double-double on legacy
//! 64-bit PowerPC. A description that carried only the width would call three of those the same.
//!
//! `char`'s signedness is a target fact and not a C fact. Unsigned on AArch64 Linux, on ARM, on
//! PowerPC and on s390x, signed on x86 and on Darwin. A program that indexes an array with a
//! `char` holding a byte over 127 works on one and not the other, and nothing in it is wrong.
