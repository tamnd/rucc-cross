//! The one classifier every ABI is run through, and the four mechanisms it is built from.
//!
//! Design: `spec/06-abis.md` section 6.7.
//!
//! [`crate::describe`] argues for the split between mechanism and policy. This is the mechanism
//! half. There are four things in here that look inside an aggregate, and every ABI in
//! [`crate::abis`] is one of them plus a size rule plus an order.
//!
//! # Ask about the return value first
//!
//! On three of the five ABIs described here, a return value that comes back in memory takes an
//! argument register with it on the way past, so a function returning a large structure has one
//! argument register fewer than the same function returning `int`. Classifying the arguments
//! before the return value gives a different answer for the last argument, and it is a different
//! answer rather than an error, which is the worst kind.
//!
//! [`Call::returns`] therefore comes first and [`Call::argument`] is asked once per argument in
//! source order. Asking out of order answers for a different program.
