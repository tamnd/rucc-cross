//! The psABIs, as descriptions.
//!
//! Design: `spec/06-abis.md` sections 6.1 to 6.5.
//!
//! Five of the fifteen ABIs on section 6.1's list, which is the four the compiler implements by
//! hand today plus Darwin arm64, and Darwin arm64 is the point. Section 6.3 argues that it is a
//! separate ABI rather than AAPCS64 with notes, and the two descriptions here differ in exactly
//! two fields, which is what "separate ABI" turns out to mean once the ABI is a described thing.
//!
//! The ten that are not here are not here because nothing emits for those targets yet. Each of
//! them is a description of this size and none of them needs a new mechanism except ELFv2, whose
//! parameter save area is a frame question rather than a classification one, and the i386 pair,
//! which need a four byte register width that [`Banks::integer_width`] already carries.
