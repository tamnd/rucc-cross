//! What a classifier is asked about, and what it answers.
//!
//! Design: `spec/06-abis.md` sections 6.2 and 6.7.
//!
//! Everything in this module is deliberately not C. A psABI does not read a C type, it reads a
//! size, an alignment, and where the scalars inside are and whether each one is an integer or a
//! floating point value. Flattening a C type down to that is the compiler's job, because that
//! is where the C type system lives, and every rule after it is the target's.
//!
//! Keeping the boundary there is what lets the descriptions in [`crate::abis`] be data. A rule
//! written over "the members of the struct" would have to know about unions, arrays, bit-fields
//! and anonymous members. A rule written over a flat list of scalars at offsets does not, and
//! every psABI on `spec/06-abis.md` section 6.1's list turns out to be expressible over the flat
//! list.

/// sixteen on x86-64, and a `long double` on AArch64 Linux is a different format entirely at the
