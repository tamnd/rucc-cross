//! The target table: which targets exist, what is true of each one today, and what this
//! specification is committed to making true of it.
//!
//! This is `spec/04-target-matrix.md` section 4.3 as data. It is the plan rather than the
//! report: section 4.7 is explicit that a tier is computed from corpus results by the reporting
//! job and never asserted by a human, so the `tier` column here is what the last reporting run
//! established and the `planned` column is the commitment. Raising a `tier` in this file
//! without a corpus run behind it is the one edit that makes the whole table worthless.
//!
//! The spec writes `*-none` as a single row covering every architecture. It is expanded here,
//! and the expansion caps each freestanding row at the tier its architecture reaches when
//! hosted, because a freestanding target and a hosted one share a back end and the freestanding
//! one cannot be better tested than the code generator underneath it.
